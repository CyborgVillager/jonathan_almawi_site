v14 <-x_x->: Reset recent Git changes: reset recent git changes, couple of errors occured when pushing to heroku, will work
                                    on this issue

v17 <-x_x-> Heroku errors: Heroku H10 & H14 Errors: Finding a solution

v18 <-x_x-> Django & Gunicorn Issues: Other issues with deploying the site onto Heroku, finding solutions

v19 <-x_x-> Updated Code info to include packages/procfile: Solution aquired, now just need to modify it to accommodate
                                                                my custom static code

v20 <-x_x-> Issues Still persit with H10 & H14 for Heroku: Issues still active, finding alternate solutions

v21 |x_x| Solution Aquired: Will use my previous code and use that for this temporaily site. Since this site is static
                            not much is needed to fix the solutions. Will be using Mezzanine & custom server
                            for future website projects.

                            This respo is not compatible with Heroku at the moment, but its able to be activated
                            via the terminal of pycharm, feel free to test it out

                            Keyphrase on the terminal -> python manage.py runserver

                            Temporialy use of a previous code -> https://github.com/CyborgVillager/c9_flask_portfolio_app
                            using flask. Good experience, so far. Thanks to seeing both the difference between
                            flask & Mezzanine. I can whole-heartly say that Mezzanine is a great choice if you want
                            more options to work with, flask is good starting point, but if you want to dive deep
                            and learn the in's and out then Mezzanine is the way to go

                            http://mezzanine.jupo.org/


v22 README added & Requirements Updated: Created a README.txt explaining the main objective of this respo, updated the

                                           anybody would like to see the difference between the updated code
                                           and the old code with out having to switch tabs and what not. Besides putting
                                           them on a different screen.

v23 Updated Contact Page: Updated contact page to include direct contact option, if a user would like to send a message
                            directly to me, with their info at hand.
