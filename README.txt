============
Basic Info
===========

This is a continuation of Respo https://github.com/CyborgVillager/jonathan_almawi_portfolio_2020
This was orignally to be used to host the site on Heroku. However after couple of versions of thinking this
through, and knowing the life-span of this temporially site. Ill be using this as a reference when I start to work
on a more dynamic usage using Mezzanine. The respo that makes the site -> https://jonathan-almawi.herokuapp.com/
active is private for now. Once I make the Mezzanine site that private respo will become public.

Anyhow feel free to use this code as a reference sheet as well, its been a good ride and planning on finding
more challenges & obstacles along the way. The more I encounter the better inform I'll be on future projects & experiments.

Besides that, have a great day (▀̿Ĺ̯▀̿ ̿)

Sinceraly,
